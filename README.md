# Blender Portfolio

This repository showcases two Blender designs created by me:

- **Lighthouse and Island Design**
- **Dungeon Design**

The project includes:

- `index.html` and `styles.css` files to display the designs on a GitHub Pages website
- Screenshots of the designs stored in the `images` folder
- Original Blender `.blend` files in the `tasarimlar` folder

## How to view the project
